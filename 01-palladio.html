<p>Page would begin with an image of Palladio map, and a brief description of what the map depicts.</p>
<h1 id="rationale">Rationale</h1>
<p>Scholarship on fugitive slaves has identified several geographic trends in the directions taken by runaways. Some slaves temporarily “laid out” in the vicinity of their owner’s farm or plantation, while some slaves ran further with the intent to stay with relatives or to reach freedom. Franklin and Schweninger’s research found that “slaves living in the Lower Mississippi River Valley or in Mississippi and Alabama were more likely to run south and west than north,” making Texas and Mexico possible destinations for runaway slaves.</p>
<p>Through a close reading of runaway slave advertisements from Texas, Mississippi, and Arkansas newspapers, we began to hypothesize that Texas had different runaway destination patterns than the other two states. William Dean Carrigan, in his article “Slavery on the frontier: the peculiar institution in central Texas” sets Texas up as “a world torn in three directions by four different cultures.” The Native American tribes and the Mexican border both helped to define Texas as a borderland through which many slaves passed to get to freedom. Many jailer notices in Arkansas advertise captured slaves originally from more eastern states, indicating that Arkansas was also a popular destination or point on the route to freedom. Given the three states compared in this research, Mississippi is the most similar to typical Southern slave-holding states, in that it was well-established and not a borderland state. From these patterns of advertisement in relationship to other states, Mississippi provides a barometer of “normalcy” that allows comparison of differences in Arkansas and Texas.</p>
<p>However, it is sometimes difficult to find patterns by simply reading through a corpus of runaway slave advertisements. Only a few slave owners mentioned a location to where a slave might be running in advertisements. Even if a slave owner provided a location, it often only shows what the owner perceived of his slave. A slaveowner in an 1836 ad from the <em>Arkansas Gazette</em> stated that “I have dreamed, with both eyes open, that he went toward the Spanish county; but as dreams are like some would be thought honest men―quite uncertain―he may have gone some other directions.” Although most fugitive slave advertisements were slightly less flowery in their language, the inaccuracies of projected direction were subtly acknowledged in the advertisements.</p>
<p>One of the only ways we can see which direction a slave was running in our collection of runaway ads is through jailer’s notices, which is a technique that Franklin and Schweninger did not utilize in analyzing projected destinations for slaves. Many jailer’s notices contained information about where the slave had run from or where his or her owner was located. Although we generally cannot tell the route that slaves were taking to get to their destinations, connecting paths between where they ran from and where they were captured can give us an idea about where they were possibly heading. Palladio provided us with the necessary tools to visualize these potential paths.</p>
<h1 id="methodology">Methodology</h1>
<p>How the Palladio maps were made, step by step.</p>
<p>First, we found two appropriate data sets from each of the states. Given the capabilities of Palladio, jailer’s notices seemed the most beneficial option. They almost universally list the owner location as reported by the runaway, thereby providing two locations for mapping (the county jail and the reported owner location). The Bexar, Pulaski, and Jefferson county jails provided a suitable sample, since they each had a similar number of advertisements (about 20) and were from around the same time period (the late 1850s). In addition, we used another data set of all jailer’s notices advertised in each state over the years 1840 to 1842.</p>
<p>Data from these three samples was then manually entered into a spreadsheet, which specifically included information on the reported owner location and the runaway location (the county jail). We also created a separate spreadsheet with the geographic coordinates listed beside these locations.</p>
<p>The next step was incorporation of this information into the digital visualization tool of <a href="http://palladio.designhumanities.org/">Palladio</a>. After the first spreadsheet (with owner and runaway locations) was uploaded as the primary table, we added location coordinate information by clicking the “Review” or “Extend” button adjacent to reported owner location, followed by the “Add a New Table” option. After the location coordinate table was also added to runaway location, visualization through mapping was possible.</p>
<p>Following the input of data, we created the maps. Choosing “Point to Point” under “Map type” allowed us a visualization of the direction slaves ran, from reported owner location to runaway location.</p>

<p>Although not many features are currently available through Palladio, the “Count by” option allows a representation of frequency through size points.</p>

<h1 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h1>
<p>Findings, questions, limitations.</p>
<p>Using Palladio as a tool for both visualization and analysis, we produced the following results from the data sets.</p>
<p><img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6454900/2766948/9ab9b752-ca33-11e3-94e9-59855642eb2b.jpg" alt="collage of ad1840-42" /> The maps created for jailer’s notices between 1840 and 1842 are disorganized and difficult to interpret. They could potentially be made more readable through the addition of arrows in order to indicate the direction taken, but currently Palladio does not have this capability.</p>
<p>The maps created from the data from a single county jail, however, prove much more useful for our purposes. As indicated by the following images, a clear argument is represented through the juxtaposition of the Texas map with the Mississippi and Arkansas maps.</p>

<p>The maps of Arkansas and Mississippi indicate that runaways came from a variety of directions and without any overwhelming patterns. The map of Texas, however, suggests that fugitive slaves caught in that region had almost universally run south and west, presumably toward Mexico. The visualization of the data supports our hypotheses about runaway destinations, and how patterns in Texas potentially might be different from those of other states.</p>
<p>Some limitations of our research stemmed from the sources themselves. The degree of specificity in listed location varied between advertisements, from cities to counties to relative locations. A few instances occurred where we were unable to find the coordinates for a historical location, so we listed those data points on the county level instead. In addition, the Texas visualization is somewhat biased by the fact that few to no slaves lived west of the Bexar county jail. Although the maps still visualize a persuasive argument, this factor should be kept in mind.</p>
<p>Palladio itself is in the process of being updated, so hopefully the user interface will become more friendly. Currently, embedding the visualizations into a website is not an option, so we have been forced to use screenshots to present our results. In addition, the number of visualization options are somewhat limited. For example, the underlying map does not have the possibility of adding the state boundaries for more clarity. Another disadvantage to working with Palladio lies in the fact that data collection is manual, and therefore time consuming.</p>
<p>An alternative to Palladio could be Google Maps, which would allow embedding and more advanced visualization options. However, the point to point lines would have to be drawn by hand, which would be labor intensive, especially depending on the size of the data set.</p>
<p>Future work in Palladio would primarily focus on collection of different samples in order to corroborate our points and to create additional persuasive visualizations. Another possible expansion would be the use of data from runaway ads, as opposed to from jailer’s notices. We could potentially find a hub location and use all fugitive slave ads that included projected runaway direction from that county.</p>
<p>Our findings from this evidence provide a starting point for continued research. The work accomplished suggests that Palladio is a beneficial digital tool in the geographic visualization of evidence. Further improvements in the program will allow for explorations both in and beyond our current data set. Palladio’s contributions to the digital humanities will ultimately expand possibilites of analysis previously unavailable to historians.</p>
